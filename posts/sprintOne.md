This was the first full week of working on project Slice-it and there has been a lot of progress already. We have a clear vision now on what the product is going to be and I think everyone in the group is excited to start developing next week. The main focus this week was building a high-fidelity prototype to get an idea of how the main userflow is going to look instead of trying to design too much during the development process.

This week was definitely interesting because it's a new project with a new group, where there will always naturally be various opinions that conflict. Considering that our team has some of the strongest personalities in the cohort, it has been very important to sit down and talk about every idea that gets brought to the table so everyone feels as if they have a voice for the project.

There was one major issue this week in the group where I had to miss a day early in the week and this was a pretty crucial day for the project since the group decided to change the name of the project completely. This was an issue to me because I had been trying to contact the group in our Discord chat, but no one was active to let me know what was going on with the project. When I returned the next day, I found out that the name had changed and I didn't really agree with it, so the group had to sit and talk about it for a majority of the day. In the end, I realized I care more about the concept of our product instead of the name and I agreed that our name could stay as Slice-It.

I think this groups workflow is very collaborative and I think it needs to stay that way in order for us to have the application that we are planning to have. Personally, I think this group will be very effective in creating this web application since all five of us have previous experience with React projects and are all excited about this idea.
